# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
We were asked to analyze how the values of some key performance metrics changed when the 9th graders of Thomas High School had their data ommitted from the original analysis due to suspected academic dishonesty.

## Purpose and Resources
This analysis used the Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook to calculate the values used in the necessary performance metrics as well as to replace all reading and math scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School with a NaN value. Those categories were:

1) Total number of schools; 2) total number of students; 3) the total budget of all schools; 4) the average math score; 5) the average reading score; 6) the percentage of students passing math; 7) the percentage of students passing reading, and 8) the overall passing percentage. 

This analysis required us to compare these metrics with and without the data for Thomas High School 9th graders and note their changes, if any.

## Results

Below are displayed the results taken from the entire student population:
